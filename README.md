###

<h3 align="left">• About</h3>

###

<p align="left">Thanks is a new code editor that is made for web development with many features. Thanks was made in TypeScript, Svelte, Electron and Tailwind<br><br>        • Simple: Theme-customizable editor, expandable up to 3 editors in a single column, you can change languages and even remove the middle editor to extend one of your remaining editors. The version is only 0.1 Beta so at the start there will be only HTML, JavaScript, CSS but in 0.2 Beta there will be added TypeScript and SCSS.<br>• Versatile: While there are not many lanuages yet, it has so many features to make coding easier. Features like file reading, editing with CTRL shortcuts, localhost and built in ChatGPT. There are many more features we would like to add, but for 0.1 Beta version that's all we have. Extensions will be added in 0.3 Beta or 1.0 version <br>• Data Saving: Whatever you write, it's going to be the same when you rejoin. But we also have a feature to disable data saving to that when you rejoin, you will be left with pure  nothing.</p>
